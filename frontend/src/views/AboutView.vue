    <h1>The cutest flower shop you'll never see</h1>
    <h2>Wildflower is your local online flower shop</h2>
    <br />
    <h3>Who are we?</h3>
    <p>
      We are a small team of flower lovers (florists and flower farmers) who want to make it easy
      for you to send flowers to your loved ones. Flowers are a beautiful way to show you care and
      we know that it can be a hassle to go to a flower shop last minute and pick out the perfect
      bouquet. That's where we come in to help!
    </p>
    <h3>Where's the shop located?</h3>
    <p>
      Great question, glad you asked. We are a small collective and our main objective in life is to
      be around flowers as much as possible. We are also aware of dwindling resources and the fact
      that the planet it slowly dying, so we decided to be smart about our investments. Instead of
      having an expensive walk in flower shop (even though we love the idea, maybe for the future),
      we decided to rent out plots of land on the outskirts of Berlin where we produce our own
      flowers and keep bee colonies. We want our business to have a positive impact on the
      environment and we want it to look cute while doing it.
